# ETDB-Download

This is an example of third party command line application written in `nodejs` to download data from ETDB-Caltech. The goal here is not only provide the functionality for bulk download but also to exemplify how a simple app can be made to leverage the distributed nature of ETDB.

For this reason, we wrote two tutorials: One for users and one for developers. Please feel free to post issues as this is still a beta release.
